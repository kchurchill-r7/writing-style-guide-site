Voice and Tone

Voice is the difference between blah and brilliant. We have to fret a bit about how we say things, not just what we say, otherwise we’re missing our chance to connect. What’s worse, we could be missing our chance to communicate because we failed to connect! Authenticity is the ultimate connective tissue, so it’s important to know ourselves and convey that in everything we write. 

Here’s who we are:

Engaging

Surprising (Thought-provoking, Unexpected)

“Control isn’t an illusion with Insight AppSec. Custom scan configurations allow you to dial-in the breadth and depth of your scans to suit your needs.”

“You have to know where you’re going to get there. Chart your progress towards established remediation goals with InsightVM’s Goals and SLA’s feature.”

Amusing (Lighthearted, Comical)

“It’s lonely here. Select a goal to populate this card with data.”

“You can test your entire workflow at once, or, for you more methodical types, test one step at a time.”

Enthusiastic (Energetic, Eager)

“First thing’s first--let’s plan your deployment!”

“InsightOps is an easy-to-use log management and analytics service for teams of all sizes. It provides world-class search capabilities, enhanced log analysis tools, and the ability to monitor and query the real-time state of your infrastructure.”

Experienced

Knowledgeable (Informed, Intelligent)

“Penetration testing is a process. Depending on which method you use, that process includes between 4 and 7 steps or phases. These phases are commonly labeled reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, post-exploitation, maintaining access, reporting, and cleaning-up.”

Educational (Instructive, Enlightening)

“InsightIDR normalizes and attributes data on AWS, but does not store credentials there. That's because the Collector identifies unnecessary logs in your environment and leaves them there to prevent transmission and storage of sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, medical records, and employee, organization, or asset names.”

Approachable

Friendly (Welcoming, Open, Warm)

“Rapid7's InsightAppSec simplifies application scanning so you can focus on remediating vulnerabilities, and that's good news whether you're an experienced Application Security professional or you're just getting started.”

Conversational (Informal, Relaxed, Familiar)

“As you make your deployment plan, think about how your network and security needs could change over time. Allocate free storage so you can scan additional assets, increase your scanning frequency, and create database backups if you need to.”

“Dashboards help you answer the question, ‘How are things going?’”

Who we are doesn’t change, and neither does our voice, but we know how to adjust our tone depending on the circumstances.
